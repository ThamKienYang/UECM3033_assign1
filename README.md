UECM3033 Numerical Methods (Assignment #1)
========================================================
--------------------------------------------------------



Since github README.md doesn't really render maths equations well, I have created another html file here for the [instructions.](http://yongkheng.github.io/UECM3033_assign1/instructions.html)



### DEADLINES:

 - This assignment will contribute to 5 marks of the coursework.
 - Assignment submission: 29/1/2016 (Friday) by 12:00 noon.
 - Peer Reviews: 5/2/2016 (Friday) by 12:00 noon.


**All deadlines are final and no extensions will be given.** Delays in submission of the assigments will delay the peer review process. A penalty of 1 mark per day will be imposed for one day late in submission of the assignment. Each student will need to review two peers. No mark will be awarded if a student failed to review the assigned peers.

You could always edit and change your submission as many time as you like. However, you are not suppose to change your submission when the peer reviews starts. Your reviewers will be asked to check the last modified dates of your files. If the dates is beyond the stipulated due dates, you will be considered as late submission and same penalty will be applied.
